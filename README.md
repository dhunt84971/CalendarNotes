# CalendarNotes
An Electron application for daily note (or journal) entries saved to a MySQL DB and searchable by words.

This is a port of an application originally written in Gambas.  Much of the coder for the calendar component was taken from a 
javascript tutorial taken from here https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-beautiful-calendar-widget--net-12538

While the settings dialog will create the database tables the setup of the MySQL database and configuration/creation of a
database and username and password is on the end user.  Keep in mind, the entered database user must be able to create tables
in order to use the create tables button.

This is a work in progress and JavaScript is relatively new to me, so any suggestions or code improvements are welcome.
